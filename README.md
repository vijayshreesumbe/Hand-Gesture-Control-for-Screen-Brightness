# Hand-Gesture-Control-for-Screen-Brightness
This project utilizes MediaPipe and OpenCV to create a real-time application that adjusts screen brightness based on hand gestures. By detecting and tracking the distance between the thumb and index finger, the system dynamically changes brightness levels, offering a hands-free user experience.
